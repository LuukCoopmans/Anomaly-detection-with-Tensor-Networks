# Anomaly-detection-with-Tensor-Networks
Python code to perform anomaly detection of datasets such as MNIST images with Tensor Networks. 
This my implementation of the code in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02516, 
which I wrote for a previous job interview assignment at google in 2021. 

Package requirements (versions of 12-4-2021):
